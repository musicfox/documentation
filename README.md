# Management App

## Quick Start

### Get help when you need it

Be sure to ask for help if you need it; click `help` in the left-hand menu. 

![Help!](.gitbook/assets/menu_bar_help.png)

{% hint style="success" %}
If you don't see the menu, you're on mobile. Click the `hamburger` to  roll the sidebar out.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To dismiss, _**click**_ _skip tutorial_ or _anywhere outside of the walk-through bubble_.
{% endhint %}

### Basic Usage

Our application offers two main introspective functions:

* Relational industry-business dynamics
  * How _has_ _your business performed_ versus peers? 
  * How _is_ _your business performing_ versus peers, today? 
  * How _will_ _your business perform_ versus peers, tomorrow?
* Business-specific capital allocation decisions
  * Given the dynamics above, what should I do _today_, _tomorrow, and the next day?_

#### Know the industry and your artists

See how _your aggregate portfolio_ is performing against your peers' portfolios by monitoring the `industry status bar`. 



![Industry status bar](.gitbook/assets/01_industry_statusbar.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
This automatically updates when our incoming data streams update, usually overnight and the comparison time range is based on your time-horizon selection.
{% endhint %}

Monitor each artists' status bar to keep tabs on performance across verticals that matter to you and to each artist, _automagically_. 

#### Glean future performance 

Using the _interactive_ consumption time series graphs, drill down your expected performance over your selected time-horizon.

You're a real pro:ðŸ‘“ @ the past, present, and future centered around _your business_.

#### Allocate your resources efficiently

> _One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results._
>
> **Milton Friedman**

Musicfox displays an asset allocation specific to your book of business, individual artist dynamics, and a holistic view of the industry. 

See where you _should_ be going and what we predict that will do for you, and your artists. Ever wonder what impact John Mayer's summer '19 tour has on _your portfolio_ ?

![Portfolio Allocation Graphic](.gitbook/assets/allocation_section.gif)

{% hint style="success" %}
All of our graphs are dynamic: _zoom_, _drag_, _click_, _whatever_! _**Double click**_ inside a graph to return it to the original state.
{% endhint %}

#### Risk to your â™¥'s desire

You control the level of fluctuation in your portfolio. Yep, that's right.

_You're in control._

![Risk slider](.gitbook/assets/risk_slider.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
You set the risk parameter here. As such, you'll see your portfolio move within the portfolio dynamics display, below.
{% endhint %}

#### Focus on your artists

See your artists in a new light. Compare consumption factors across your portfolio _and_ the industry, while Musicfox monitors and recommends marketing verticals.

{% hint style="info" %}
We optimize consumption marketing recommendations based on each individual artists' competitive quantitative dynamics _within the context of your holistic book of business_.
{% endhint %}

####  Artist Overview

Keep tabs on each portfolio artist and know how they're doing to peers, in a single glance. Catch fan highlights, real-time socials, and top-generating playlists in the context of what matters

#### Performance and Statistics

Dive deep into your artists' past, present, and future performance dynamics. 

![Artist Performance - Ariana Grande](.gitbook/assets/artist_performance.gif)

The **stats tool** can help to mobilize those unique money-making differences that your most successful artists possess.

> Compare Drake's past returns with the industry. 
>
> See how many observations are centered slightly positively around zero for Drake, versus the industry? Look at you, ðŸ¤“!

#### Todos

Okay, let's be honest: you're going to like it when we tell you what to do. Seriously. 

We automatigically generate each artist's _low-hanging-fruit_ verticals so you can focus on your job making things sing. Take the guesswork out of your next move and further hone your management expertise.

## Management App Features

A somewhat exhaustive overview of the features found at app.musicfox.io.

### Concepts: Risk, Return, and Everything Between 

We're changing this music business game and that means you'll need to reacquaint some of your management skills. 

> Read the concepts below and you'll manage your book of business like Warren Buffett runs Berkshire Hathaway.

#### Risk ðŸ›¡ 

At the core of Musicfox sits _risk_. It's a funny concept, and one most of us deeply understand and misunderstand, at once. Risk can be defined in many different ways; here, we'll see it in two lights, quantitatively:  

1. volatility, or how much something moves around, over time, and,
2. loss-aversion, or a tangible dollar amount beneficial parties are willing to lose in order to gain some tangible dollar amount.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Volatility_: we typically define this as the square-root of a time-series' variance. This is synonymous with $$\sigma$$ or standard deviation. 

_Loss_-_aversion_: on average, how much is the average professional for your average artist type willing to lose, in order to continue operations?
{% endhint %}

#### Return ðŸš€ 

As you may have guessed, the risk concept we dove into above has little meaning without its complement, return or reward. 

This is the one we all understand: stay away from the cookie jar and mom gives you another cookie. Get involved early and she puts you in time-out.

![Logout](.gitbook/assets/logout.gif)

### Google Accounts

We use Google as our sole authentication provider for a multitude of reasons, though leveraging Google's credential security being the primary concern. 

Signing up for a [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com) is free and you likely already have one, anyways.

![Sign up for a Google Account](.gitbook/assets/newaccount.gif)

{% hint style="success" %}
 Passwords are critical. At Musicfox we recommend you use a long password \(15+ characters\) with multiple character types.

Accomplish this by using your favorite sentence, e.g.  "I  gained superpowers after using Musicfox."

Okay, seriously, don't use that one. But you get the point.
