## Basic Usage

Our application offers two main introspective functions:

* Relational industry-business dynamics
  * How _has_ _your business performed_ versus peers? 
  * How _is_ _your business performing_ versus peers, today? 
  * How _will_ _your business perform_ versus peers, tomorrow?
* Business-specific capital allocation decisions
  * Given the dynamics above, what should I do _today_, _tomorrow, and the next day?_

### Know the industry and your artists

See how _your aggregate portfolio_ is performing against your peers' portfolios by monitoring the `industry status bar`.

{% hint style="info" %}
This automatically updates when our incoming data streams update, usually overnight and the comparison time range is based on your time-horizon selection.
{% endhint %}

Monitor each artists' status bar to keep tabs on performance across verticals that matter to you and to each artist, _automagically_. 

### Glean future performance 

Using the _interactive_ consumption time series graphs, drill down your expected performance over your selected time-horizon.

You're a real pro:ðŸ‘“ @ the past, present, and future centered around _your business_.

### Allocate your resources efficiently

> _One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results._

Musicfox displays an asset allocation specific to your book of business, individual artist dynamics, and a holistic view of the industry. 

See where you _should_ be going and what we predict that will do for you, and your artists. Ever wonder what impact John Mayer's summer '19 tour has on _your portfolio_ ?

{% hint style="success" %}
All of our graphs are dynamic: _zoom_, _drag_, _click_, _whatever_! _**Double click**_ inside a graph to return it to the original state.
{% endhint %}

### Risk to your â™¥'s desire

You control the level of fluctuation in your portfolio. Yep, that's right.

_You're in control._
