## Concepts: Risk, Return, and Everything Between 

We're changing this music business game and that means you'll need to reacquaint some of your management skills. 

> Read the concepts below and you'll manage your book of business like Warren Buffett runs Berkshire Hathaway.

#### Risk ðŸ›¡ 

At the core of Musicfox sits _risk_. It's a funny concept, and one most of us deeply understand and misunderstand, at once. Risk can be defined in many different ways; here, we'll see it in two lights, quantitatively:  

1. volatility, or how much something moves around, over time, and,
2. loss-aversion, or a tangible dollar amount beneficial parties are willing to lose in order to gain some tangible dollar amount.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Volatility_: we typically define this as the square-root of a time-series' variance. This is synonymous with $$\sigma$$ or standard deviation. 

_Loss_-_aversion_: on average, how much is the average professional for your average artist type willing to lose, in order to continue operations?
{% endhint %}

#### Return ðŸš€ 

As you may have guessed, the risk concept we dove into above has little meaning without its complement, return or reward. 

This is the one we all understand: stay away from the cookie jar and mom gives you another cookie. Get involved early and she puts you in time-out.
