### Overview

Fan.Booster is Musicfox's solution to transform passive viewers and listeners into loyal and marketable followers. Musicfox applies proprietary algorithms to dynamically allocate funds across platforms in real-time, thus creating a bespoke way to optimize and prioritize follower acquisition ad spend like never before.

Fan.Booster consists of three distinct components.
