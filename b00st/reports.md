# Reports

## What reports do I get with B00ST? 

With B00ST you get two types of reports: _regular_ and _on-demand._

#### Regular reports

You'll receive daily update snippets of the overall campaign, delivered right to your inbox. These typically update from ad platforms 3-4 times a day and _are sent to you each morning_.

#### On-demand reports \(coming soon!\)

Can't find your morning email? Don't want to search? Simply email your trusty team@b00st.com with 

> _"I'd like a report for campaign &lt;insert-b00st-id-here&gt;"_

in your email message. 

â›± Then sit tight, your report is on its way. 

## What are the metrics you're reporting? 

We report on four main metrics: `cpc`_, `cpm`, `ctr`,_ and _total `spend`._ 

### B00ST report metrics:

#### `cpc`

**Cost-per-click** is the average amount of money it took for a click during your campaign. 

{% hint style="info" %}
These can range anywhere from $.05 - $5, depending on the platform,  ad content, and timing of each ad placement.

_But don't fret!_ -- _the B00ST team manages this for you!_ 
{% endhint %}

#### `cpm`

**Cost-per-impression** is the average amount of money it took for your ad to be served to 1000 ðŸ‘€ 

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is the _least_ reliable metric in digital advertising, though the _most_ homogeneous across ad-platforms.
{% endhint %}

#### `ctr`

**Click-through-rate** is the average percentage of clicks that went through to their destination. 

This metric gives you \(and the B00ST algos\) an idea of how much interaction an ad, its content, and timing, is generating.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The actual CTR calculation is number of clicks divided by impressions, so bear in mind that this metric is also subject to reliability/reporting issues inherent in determining "what" constitutes an impression.
{% endhint %}

#### `spend`

**Total-spend** is the cumulative sum of your B00ST campaign thus far. Spend a buck yesterday two today? Spend should be $3.
