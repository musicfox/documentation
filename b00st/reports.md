# Reports

## What reports do I get with B00ST?&#x20;

With B00ST you get two types of reports: _regular_ and _on-demand._

#### Regular reports

You'll receive daily update snippets of the overall campaign, delivered right to your inbox. These typically update from ad platforms 3-4 times a day and _are sent to you each morning_.

#### On-demand reports (coming soon!)

Can't find your morning email? Don't want to search? Simply email your trusty team@b00st.com with&#x20;

> _"I'd like a report for campaign \<insert-b00st-id-here>"_

in your email message.&#x20;

:beach\_umbrella: Then sit tight, your report is on its way.&#x20;

## What are the metrics you're reporting?&#x20;

We report on four main metrics: `cpc`_, `cpm`, `ctr`,_ and _total `spend`._&#x20;

### B00ST report metrics:

#### `cpc`

**Cost-per-click** is the average amount of money it took for a click during your campaign.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
These can range anywhere from $.05 - $5, depending on the platform,  ad content, and timing of each ad placement.

_But don't fret!_ -- _the B00ST team manages this for you!_&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### `cpm`

**Cost-per-impression** is the average amount of money it took for your ad to be served to 1000 :eyes:&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is the _least_ reliable metric in digital advertising, though the _most_ homogeneous across ad-platforms.
{% endhint %}

#### `ctr`

**Click-through-rate** is the average percentage of clicks that went through to their destination.&#x20;

This metric gives you (and the B00ST algos) an idea of how much interaction an ad, its content, and timing, is generating.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The actual CTR calculation is number of clicks divided by impressions, so bear in mind that this metric is also subject to reliability/reporting issues inherent in determining "what" constitutes an impression.
{% endhint %}

#### `spend`

**Total-spend** is the cumulative sum of your B00ST campaign thus far. Spend a buck yesterday and two bucks today? Spend should be $3.&#x20;
