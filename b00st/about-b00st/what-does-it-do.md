B00ST removes uncertainty and maximizes results by updating campaign elements in real-time to save time and money.
{% endhint %}

### Where are ads published?

Ads are published on Instagram, Facebook, Google, and YouTube. **To enhance security for artists and simplify the process we run dark posts from our B00ST channels that promote artists content**. Artists don't have to give up access to their socials and only pay when fans click on their content and land on their properties. Win-win!

{% hint style="info" %}
Our software starts broad and narrows down the elements (channels, budget, creative, detailed targeting, etc.) that lead to the best results for each campaign.

### What does an example ad look like?

Below is an example of an ad promoting our own software. B00ST uses the creative you provide alongside copy and call-to-action options created by AI, custom to your campaign.
