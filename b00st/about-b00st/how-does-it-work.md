# How does it work?

B00ST runs ads on behalf of artists across social channels to promote their brand and content. 

## team@b00st.com 

We use email as our main mode of communicating and executing things at B00ST. As a result, B00ST can be used by anyone anywhere. 

{% hint style="success" %}
Our team is assisted by top of the line robots and algos that make sure every campaign detail is executed expertly with lightning speed. 
{% endhint %}

**If you want to start, stop, or pause a campaign, just email** [**team@b00st.com**](mailto:team@b00st.com) **with your intent in the email message.**  

## Where are ads published?

Ads are published on Instagram, Facebook, and Google/YouTube. **To enhance security for artists and simplify the process we run dark posts across our B00ST channels that promote artists content**. Artists don't have to give up access to their socials and only pay when fans click on their content and land on their properties. Win-win!
