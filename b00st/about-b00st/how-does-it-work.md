## What can be promoted?

**B00ST is designed to promote any target link or channel**. For example, to grow YouTube enter a link to a video or YouTube channel. To grow Instagram enter an instagram profile link. To grow Spotify enter a link to a profile/song/album on Spotify, and so forth. **From the info provided our software will devise the mathematically optimal way to promote your target destination.** 

Advanced users can select a list of channels and content to focus on for every campaign by emailing [team@b00st.com](mailto:team@b00st.com?body=Start%20a%20new%20campaign.). B00ST takes it from there and runs ads geared for maximum results and lowest costs.

## Where are ads published?

Ads are published on Instagram, Facebook, Google, and YouTube. **To enhance security for artists and simplify the process we run dark posts from our B00ST channels that promote artists content**. Artists don't have to give up access to their socials and only pay when fans click on their content and land on their properties. Win-win! 

{% hint style="info" %}
Our software starts broad and narrows down the elements \(channels, budget, creative, detailed targeting, etc.\) that lead to the best results for each campaign.
