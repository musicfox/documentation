# How does it work?

## Real fan, no bots 

**B00ST ads target real fans**. Our tech detects and minimizes bots \(the web is full of them\) to deliver artists real eyeballs on their content.

## The process, in detail

Geek alert üòÅ! **B00ST algos and software are geared to save artists money while achieving optimal return on investment \(= bang for your buck\)**.

### How does targeting work?

It starts with analyzing social channels for each artist, the industry, and that artist's peers, over time, to compose the initial ad buying recommendations. B00ST draws from tons of different data sources such as music consumption, touring activity, and socials to accurately build high-value target groups for each artist.

### Where is the money spent?

B00ST is plugged into Google, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook - more platforms coming soon. Deep inside this portion lies mathematical portfolio allocation and asset valuation software, which makes data transformations and produces the ad allocation set.

### How does optimization work?

Once the initial allocations are fixed, we perform A/B testing via regression analysis to determine what demo, creative, and copy produces the optimal ROI per channel at the respective moment in time.

After a campaign launches the software regularly updates all campaign elements. We call this Dynamic Tactical Allocation, which helps produce optimal ad spends through time.
