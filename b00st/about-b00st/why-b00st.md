# How does it work?

Geek alert üòÅ! **B00ST algos and software are geared to save artists money while achieving optimal return on investment \(= bang for your buck\)**. It starts with analyzing social channels for each artist, the industry, and that artist's peers, over time, to compose the initial ad buying recommendations. Deep inside this portion lies mathematical portfolio allocation and asset valuation software which makes data transformations and produces the ad allocation set.

Once the initial allocations are fixed, we perform A/B testing via regression analysis to determine what demo, creative, and copy produces the optimal ROI per channel at the respective moment in time.

After a campaign launches the software regularly updates all campaign elements. We call this Dynamic Tactical Allocation, which helps produce optimal ad spends through time.
