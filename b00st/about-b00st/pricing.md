# How much does it cost?

**One campaign up-to $500 is free, every month.**

Subsequent campaigns can be run with as little as $50 in ad spend, with a simple 10% fee.&#x20;

If you are thinking about running a lot of campaigns for different artists on a regular basis, please check out our [pro tier](https://b00st.com/#pricing) or drop us an email

Our payment partner Stripe charges a card processing fee for all payments. Invoices are due before campaign launch.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
If you pause or stop a campaign, funds will be held in your account and can be credited towards the next campaign. We’re not able to process refunds, however.
