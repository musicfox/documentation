# How much does it cost?

The minimum B00ST campaign budget is $50. **For campaigns between $50-$100 we don't charge anything**. For campaigns above $100 we add a simple 10% usage fee.&#x20;

If you are thinking about running a lot of campaigns for different artists on a regular basis, please give us a call or drop us an email.

Our payment partner Stripe charges a card processing fee for all payments. Invoices are due before campaign launch.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
If you pause or stop a campaign, funds will be held in your account and can be credited towards the next campaign. Weâ€™re not able to process refunds, however.
