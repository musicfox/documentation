# How much does it cost?

We charge a simple 10% fee of the ad budget.&#x20;

Good news is that we waive our fee for one campaign up-to $500 in ad spend, every month, which means that you can effectively use our software for free.&#x20;

If you are thinking about running a lot of campaigns for different artists on a regular basis, please check out our [pro tier](https://b00st.com/#pricing) or drop us an email.
