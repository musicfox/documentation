# During a campaign

## Campaign Duration

Our campaigns are tailored for maximal total results with minimal cost-per-result. A good guideline is two to four weeks per campaign.

## Campaign Actions

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need to make changes, the best way is to stop the campaign and start a new one. No worries, we'll credit your account the remaining campaign budget.

Below are some of the most common campaign actions. To initiate please paraphrase what you're trying to get done and email it to [team@b00st.com](mailto:team@b00st.com)

**Account:** add or remove users. This is beneficial if you want your team to have viewing access to your campaign. Viewing access includes daily reports. 

**Help**: if you are stuck you can ask for for help. If there is something wrong with your campaign, we suggest you pause your campaign immediately and investigate our `how-to` docs for answers. 

**Pause**: pause your campaign to put things on a temporary hold. 

**Pay**: to pay an invoice or receive details on past campaigns.

**Report**: receive a reports for all campaigns running on your account. 

**Restart**: restart a paused campaign. 

**Stop**: permanently stop your campaign. Think of this as the finish/conclude button. We recommend you you stop a campaign and create a new one if you need to make changes to a running campaign.
