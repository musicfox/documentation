# During a campaign

## Campaign Duration

Our campaigns are tailored for maximal total results with minimal cost-per-result. A good guideline is two to four weeks per campaign.

**Help**: if there is something wrong with your campaign, we suggest to pause your campaign immediately and investigate our [`how-to`](https://www.b00st.com/) docs or join our [Slack channel](https://docs.musicfox.io/b00st/run-a-campaign/slack). 

**Pause**: pause your campaign to put things on a temporary hold. 

**Pay**: to pay an invoice or receive details on past campaigns.

**Report**: receive a reports for all campaigns running on your account.
