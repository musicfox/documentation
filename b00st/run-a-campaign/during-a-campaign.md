# During a campaign

## Campaign Duration

Our campaigns are tailored for maximal total results with minimal cost-per-result. A good guideline is two to four weeks per campaign.

## Campaign Actions

{% hint style="danger" %}
Once a campaign has started, you cannot make changes. If something is wrong, the best way forward is to stop the campaign and start a new one. No worries, we'll credit your account with the remaining campaign budget, no questions asked.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Below are some of the most common actions. To initiate any of them please paraphrase what you're trying to get done and email it to** [**team@b00st.com**](mailto:team@b00st.com)****

{% hint style="success" %}
Keep your 8-digit B00ST campaign ID handy when you email [team@b00st.com](mailto:team@b00st.com). You can find it on your daily report or your campaign confirmation email.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**(coming soon) Account:** add or remove users. This is beneficial if you want your team to have viewing access to your campaign. Viewing access includes daily reports.&#x20;

**Help**: if there is something wrong with your campaign, we suggest to pause your campaign immediately and investigate our [`how-to`](https://www.b00st.com) docs or join our [Discord Community ](https://discord.com/invite/twpSQ9FtZ4).&#x20;

**Pause**: pause your campaign to put things on a temporary hold.&#x20;

**Pay**: to pay an invoice or receive details on past campaigns.

**Report**: receive a basic report for all campaigns running on your account. We are working on more detailed reports (coming soon).

**Ad metric acronyms - See the B00ST** [**Reports**](../reports.md) **section for further details**

CPC (Cost per click) = the price you pay when a fan clicks your ad

Impressions = the number of people who potentially see your ad

CTR (Click-through rate) = a ratio showing how often people who see your ad end up clicking it. CTR is calculated by dividing clicks by impressions
{% endhint %}

**Restart**: restart a paused campaign.&#x20;

**Stop**: permanently stop your campaign. Think of this as the finish/conclude button. We recommend you stop a campaign and create a new one if you need to make changes to a running campaign.  &#x20;
