# Pricing

## How much does it cost?

The minimum B00ST campaign budget is $50. **For campaigns between $50-$100 we don't charge anything**. For campaigns above $100 we add a simple 10% usage fee. It's that simple. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Our payment partner Stripe charges a card processing fee for all payments. Invoices are due before campaign launch. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are thinking about running a lot of campaigns for different artists on a regular basis, please give us a call.
{% endhint %}

## **What if I pause or stop a campaign?**

Funds will be held in your account and can be credited towards the next campaign. Weâ€™re not able to process refunds, however**.**
