# Pricing

## How much does it cost?

The minimum campaign budget is $50. For campaigns between $50-$99 we don't charge anything. For campaigns above $100 we charge a simple 10% usage fee.

Our payment partner Stripe charges an additional card processing fee for all payments. Invoices are due before campaign launch.
