# Pricing

## How much does it cost?

For campaigns between $50-$99 we don't charge anything. For campaigns above $100 we charge a simple 10% usage fee. The minimum B00ST campaign budget is $50, it's that simple.

Our payment partner Stripe charges a card processing fee for all payments. Invoices are due before campaign launch.
