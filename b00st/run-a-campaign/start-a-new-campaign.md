Advanced users, sign in [b00st.com](https://b00st.com/) and email [team@b00st.com](mailto:team@b00st.com?body=Start%20a%20new%20campaign.) with something like “_start a new campaign_” in the message. Our software will take it from there and get your campaign started in no time. It's that simple!

During the set up process our software learns about the artist and objective and sets up A/B tests.
